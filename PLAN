Still need to test:

    php_stderr_processor callback
    t/12-postprocess manipulate headers

FEATURE PLAN, OUTSTANDING ISSUES
--------------------------------

hooks in MojoX::Template::PHP::interpret:
    allow multiple callbacks to be registered on each hook?

What does PHP do with a parameter name like  foo[][4] ?

Do we have to apply  _php_method_params  to  $params->{_FILES}  too ?

What does  MojoX::Template::PHP  do when confronted with a PHP compile error?
What should it do?

Waht does MojoX::Template::PHP  do with a PHP run-time error?
What should it do?

Mojolicious::Plugin::EPRenderer sets  auto_escape  to "avoid XSS attacks".
Does this plugin need to avoid XSS attacks?

Do I want to rename the packages in this class? Say, to
MojoX::PHP::Plugin and MojoX::PHP::Template?

    Advantages
    ----------
    no overwhelming number of PHP.pm<n> buffers in emacs

    Disadvantages
    -------------
    MojoX::Foo::Plugin is not as conventional as MojoX::Plugin::Foo

Or maybe I want to name it  Mojolicious::Plugin::PHP ? There are 
currently no  MojoX::Plugin::xxx  modules that I'm aware of.

how about another config:  use_index_php => true | false | undef
if false, do not search for  index.php  file in each request.
if undef, search for  index.php  when request ends in  /  (this can
be the default behavior)
