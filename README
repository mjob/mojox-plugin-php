MojoX-Plugin-PHP 0.04
=====================

A plugin for using PHP as a templating system for your
Mojolicious web application.

Let's suppose you have some php files  foo.php  and  bar/baz.php
that do something useful for you. To use them within your Mojolicious
application, you only need to enable this plugin, place the php
files under your Mojolicious application's  /templates  or  /public
directory, and make requests on your server for the paths

    /foo.php
    /bar/baz.php

Even though the web server is written in Perl, the response for
these requests will be just as if the request was processed by a PHP
interpreter. That's because it was.

FEATURES

* Mojolicious stash variables are availble in the PHP program
  as global variables.

* Possible to preprocess PHP program inputs ($_GET, $_SERVER, 
  the stash variables, etc.) before PHP processing begins.

* Possible to postprocess the PHP output and response headers
  before delivering the response from Mojolicious.

* Powerful mechanism to trigger execution of arbitrary Perl
  code from PHP and to deliver the result so it can be used
  by PHP.

* All the adequacy of PHP in your Mojolicious application


DEPENDENCIES

This distribution depends on Dmitry Karasik's PHP distribution,
which is a Perl module (available on CPAN) for using a PHP 
interpreter from Perl. PHP (i.e., the Perl module called PHP)
in turn depends on a PHP installation built with the embedded
SAPI library (say, built from source after running
./configure --enable-embed ... )  The PHP module is availble
from CPAN or from github at https://github.com/dk/p5-php .
